# Seven Kids Children’s Centre

There are four study programs for children.

One of them is mental arithmetic, which harmoniously develops the mental and creative abilities of children and adolescents through arithmetic calculations on a special counting frame - an abacus.

There is also a spelling program, a course on memory development, reading speed development, and preschool training.

## Goals

1. Develop a platform for teaching children mental arithmetic.
2. Create an administrator module to manage schools and staff.

## Solution

The Seven Kids solution includes an administrator web application and a mobile app for students. The admin panel allows interaction with the project partners and staff management.

The mobile application for iOS and Android helps children do their homework.

For each child, the player statistics are collected: time spent in the game, scores for correct answers, etc. Teachers have access to the data via the web application.

### Design

The game starts on the island. Like in real life, seasons change there. It results in the respective changes to interface design.

The last and most difficult level is made in space style. Players get to a new planet, where they do tasks.

Friendly characters make the visuals brighter. Seven, the boy, and his friend Ruby, the robot, are designed so that children of different ages like them.

They were created with the canons of pedagogy in mind: the education game character is someone who players associate themselves with. It is as if a child puts themself in the hero's shoes, or perceives the character as a friend, whom he wants to be like.

### Peculiarities

The team had to immerse themselves in the project. To understand the logic of the application for mental arithmetic, the Citronium team had to learn how to count on an abacus.

The main difficulty was the synchronization of the app’s complex algorithms with the education system used for teaching mental arithmetic. It is much easier to teach a person how to count using the mental arithmetic method than to teach an app to do it.

There are several levels of sums in the project and on each level, there are certain rules for adding, subtracting, and other mathematical operations. The developers had to write numerous additional conditions to make the algorithms work properly.

### Sound Recording

Another interesting task was sound recording. Adding a realistic voice to the application was not easy at all. The Russian language is very complicated with numerous grammar forms for different parts of speech, many exceptions, etc.

Due to the mobile stress in the numerals and their derivatives, standard digitizing of words was not enough. Initially, the OS voice processor was used, but it sounded too robotic and metallic.

We literally taught the application to speak Russian correctly with the help of a professional announcer.

### Further Development

To diversify the gameplay, we have implemented six more game modes aimed at developing concentration and memory:

1. «Do the sum».
1. «Remember in the right order».
1. «Read the text».
1. «Find the zo-zo».
1. «Make the word».
1. «Find the item».

## As the Result

Our solution helped create and develop a franchise in the fast-growing market of demanded services. This product was one of the first in its field.

«We started working with Citronium in spring, 2017. Our task was to create an online program for all devices. And the Citronium team coped with it in a truly professional way.

I would like to thank them very much. They dealt with the project in a really creative way: each time we got a lot of different variants of solving the task. Now we are ready to work with this IT company on a regular basis. Thank you for your professionalism!»
