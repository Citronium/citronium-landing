# Seven Kids

Here children are engaged in four programs.

One of them is mental arithmetic, which harmoniously develops the mental and creative abilities of children and adolescents with the help of arithmetic calculations on special accounts --- abacus.

There is also a spelling program, a course on memory development, reading speed and preschool preparation.

## Goals

1. Develop a platform for teaching children mental arithmetic.
2. Make an administrative module for managing schools, including --- staff.

## Solution

Seven Kids consists of a web application for administrators, teachers and a mobile application for students.
Through the admin panel, you can interact with project partners and manage staff.

With the help of a mobile app for iOS and Android, children do their homework.

Statistics are collected for each child: time in the game, points for correct answers, and so on. Teachers get access to the data through a web application.

### Design

Starting to play, the child gets to the island. And here, as in real life, there is a change of seasons.
Depending on this, the interface design also changes.

The last, most difficult level is made in the space style. Players get to a new planet and complete tasks there.

Friendly characters make the visual part more lively.
The boy Seven and his robot friend Ruby are chosen so that they are well perceived by children of different ages.

They were created taking into account the canons of pedagogy: a character in a game training material is something with which a child associates himself, he seems to put himself in the place of a hero, or perceives him as a friend, a comrade, whom he wants to be like.

### Nuances

The team was required to fully immerse themselves in the specifics of the project. To understand the logic of the application focused on oral mental counting, the guys from Citronium had to learn to count on the abacus themselves.

The main difficulty was the synchronization of complex algorithms of the application with the numeracy training system used in mental arithmetic. Teaching a person to count by the method of mental arithmetic is much easier than an application.

There are several levels of mathematical examples in the project and at each level there are certain conditions for addition, subtraction and other mathematical actions. The developers had to prescribe a lot of additional conditions in order to achieve the correct operation of the algorithms.

### Sound

Another task was voicing. It was not easy to introduce a realistic voice into the application. The Russian language is very complex: declensions, conjugations, exceptions, and so on.

Because of the mobility of stress in the derivatives of numerals, simply digitizing words was not enough. Initially, the voice processor of operating systems was used, but at the same time the voice turned out to be robotic, "metallic".

With the help of the services of a professional speaker, I had to literally teach the application to speak Russian correctly.

### Further development

For a variety of gameplay in the future, we have implemented six more game modes aimed at developing concentration and memory:

1. Solve an example. 
1. Remember in order.
1. Read the text.
1. Find zo-zo.
1. Collect the word.
1. Find the object.

## In the end

Our development has helped to create and develop a franchise in the fast-growing market of in-demand services. This product has become one of the first in its field.

«We started working with Citronium in the spring of 2017. Our task was to create an online program for all devices. And the Citronium team handled it really professionally.

I would like to express my great gratitude to them. They approached the project really creatively: each time we received many different solutions to the task. Now we are ready to constantly work with this company. Thank you for your professionalism!»
