# Prosto: meditation and sleep

An application from Irena Ponaroshku. She is actively engaged in meditation herself and wants to help people learn how to do it correctly.

The creator of the app wants to make meditation clear and simple. Irena is convinced that meditation helps to become more sincere with yourself, to understand your goals and priorities, to prepare for change and development.

According to the idea of the author of the idea, the art of meditation should become accessible to everyone, regardless of experience, so that beginners can gradually get involved in the process and advance in a new skill.

And it can be implemented simply --- using the application in the phone.

## Project features

During the development of the project, we did not experience any special difficulties. The real challenges began after the release. Together with technical support, we had to actively engage in the process of training users, some of whom did not know basic things, for example, how to subscribe.

Another task was related to the player, with which all the content is launched. High-quality operation of the player was one of the main requirements.

The player starts meditations online, and we need to receive an audio stream in real time, process it so that playback goes on without pauses. To do this, we changed the format from MP3 to HLS: with this format, the audio file is not in its entirety, but in small pieces that are easier to send and receive.

We loved this application and it was very important to us that it worked correctly so that the customer and users were satisfied. Therefore, we have always been in touch with technical support, personally advised, delved into every appeal, found a solution and helped to communicate with users, although this is not included in the work on the project.

Also on the release, we faced a lot of hype. The application was the first in the list of the most downloaded in the store for several days, the audience grew in gigantic volumes, and on the first day 33 thousand people became users of the application.

## Customer feedback

### Dmitry Provotorov, Product Manager, Customer Representative

«We chose you because, firstly, you were ready to write on a modern technological stack --- to use React Native for development, you had specialists for it. What was super important for us was that you were open to interviewing your developers, we had the opportunity to determine who from your team to connect to the project. And you provided us with the shortest possible time and everything necessary so that we could make a decision.

What I like about working with you is management that is open to communication: we are constantly in touch, we do not feel in an information vacuum, we do not feel even within the daily routine. We have a distributed team, we work from all over the world and at the same time we keep in touch at any time, we receive any feedback as quickly as possible.

From the point of view of how the team did the work, we did a code review, we monitored how the service works at the start, we tested our chosen architecture, everything went fine. The main KPI for us was the launch without problems, it was important for us that users did not encounter any technical problems at the start, when servers may overload or fall off, services may not work due to the influx of visitors. And everything went great. At the testing stages, we chose the right architecture, the right partners with whom we hosted our software, chose the right service that was responsible for sending SMS, insured ourselves by connecting several services. All this was done both promptly and as comfortably as possible.

And now, after launching the application, we receive wonderful support from your side, prompt response and feel technically safe, we understand that we are working with experts.

The most important thing for us is the technical stability and functioning of the solution that we are developing, and from this point of view you are great fellows. And our main victory is that at the start, when in the first few days we received tens of thousands of registrations, tens of thousands of users began to meditate with us, that each of them received excellent service and did not encounter any problems. This is our most important victory. I recommend you to everyone.»
