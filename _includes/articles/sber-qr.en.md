## Goals and objectives
1. Tell us about the new possibility of payment using QR codes.
2. Through the game, teach people to make payments using QR codes.
3. Increase the popularity of non-cash payments.

## Solution

The virtual game connects with reality using geolocation and the use of real objects from Sberbank partner companies. A similar approach was implemented in games like "Ingress" and "Pokemon Go".

The player sees the companies participating in the game on the map next to him. He can get all the information about the organization, buy its virtual shares or rent an area.

You can get dividends from shares and invest them in a business. The more experience a player has, the higher the level in the game and the financial possibilities.
