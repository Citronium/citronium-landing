## Goals and Objectives

1. Tell about the new way of payment using QR codes.
2. By game playing, teach people to make payments with QR codes.
3. Increase the popularity of non-cash payments.

## Solution

The virtual game connects to reality by using geolocation and real objects from Sberbank's partner companies. A similar approach has been implemented in games like Ingress and Pokemon Go.

The player sees the nearest companies involved in the game on a map. He can get all the information about the organization, buy its virtual shares or rent space.

The shares can be used to get dividends and invest them in the business. The more experience the player gets, the higher the game level and the financial capability.
