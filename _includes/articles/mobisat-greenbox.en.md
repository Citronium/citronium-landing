MOBISAT has developed a geolocation device that allows you to determine the location of the car and transmit all the main transport indicators.

Our task was to write software for this device.

## Goals

1. Develop an application with a functional design.
1. Ensure high security of customers' personal data.
1. Create the possibility of using multiple devices by one user.
1. Providing information to users, both technical and related to driving styles.

## Solution

1. The "Find my transport" function.
1. Tracking of a car, water vessels, etc.
1. Integration of OSM maps.
1. Remote tracking of one or more objects.
1. Trip history (start and stop times).
1. Generating and viewing reports, movement history.

## How it works

**Parental control**: warning when exceeding the speed limit or manually set and informing about dangerous driving --- sudden acceleration, braking, turns, etc.

**Virtual Dashboard**: reproduces the dashboard of the car --- speed, engine speed, fuel, diagnostic trouble codes, throttle pressure and so on.

**Remote diagnostics**: information about errors in the operation of the car.

**Advanced Reporting**: Creates detailed reports on the performance of your car --- mileage reports, detailed analysis of each trip, travel time, fuel consumption and so on.

**Alarm Management**: The app can alert you in case of danger by sending notifications to your smartphone. Notifications are configurable.

**Two mapping services are available to choose from**: Google Maps and Open Street Maps.

## Result

Our development made it possible to scale the client's business, designed to manage several hundred devices.

Now, with our software, the customer is actively developing business and working with five major auto and moto brands.
