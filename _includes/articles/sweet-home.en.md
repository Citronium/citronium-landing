Taking into account the business logic, access to information is provided both to the medical organization and to the insurer with whom the patient has a contract. Our proposed time tracking system for the customer's task is available in the browser and in mobile applications on iOS and Android devices.

### Difficulties

Faced with difficulties in developing business logic. The Russian and American healthcare systems are different, and it was not easy to dive into the logic of providing services in this area in the United States.

We conducted a study and described in detail the entire process of providing services and quality control. We have allocated 4 user roles with different access rights.

### Result

We have created mobile and web versions of the application so that it is convenient to use them from smartphones, tablets and computers.

The developed system allows you to thoroughly monitor the process of providing services to patients at all stages: from assessing the quality and compliance of the volume of work with the weekly plan of the employee and to collecting general information throughout the company.

The received data is imported into Google tables, in which the analysis takes place according to the parameters required by the customer.

Employees in the application can record the service time spent by orderlies or medics while caring for patients in an electronic form. The patient can sign the form with the specified time. With the help of the application, these forms are sent to the management.

The administrative staff in the application checks the correctness of filling out the forms, exports to the summary table, assigns patients to doctors to provide services, manages staff and work with patients, exports and prints completed forms and summary tables, if necessary.
