## Goals and objectives

1. E-commerce
1. Online payment within the app
1. Geolocation
1. Marketplace
1. Booking a table

## Solution

The startup management wanted to reach the maximum audience and launch the project in a short time. For these purposes, a solution for iOS, Android and Web was chosen.

### Difficulties

The first version of the application had to be launched just a month after the start of work.

To do this, we had to connect more developers, which resulted in a heavy load on the manager. Daily communication with the client helped to adjust the development process.

### Development

In 2014, the project was implemented in Bristol, the success of the application also led to the positioning of Wriggle in two more cities in the UK: Bristol and Cardiff.
