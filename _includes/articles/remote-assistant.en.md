## Solution

To create the software solution, we selected two groups of data:

1. For drivers, the information is shown in the mobile application.
2. For car dealers - in the web application.

The driver receives timely notifications about the necessity to service the car, change the oil, etc.

KIA service specialists can see the information required for primary diagnostics of each car on the computer.

Via the app, users can communicate with KIA technical support. So they can quickly obtain information in an emergency: to call a tow truck in case of an accident or serious damage to the vehicle, and even to find a stolen car.
