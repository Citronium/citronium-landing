## Solution

To create a software solution, we have identified 2 groups of data:

1. For motorists, the information is transmitted to the mobile application.
2. For car dealerships --- in a web application.

The driver receives timely notifications about the need for maintenance of the car, oil change, and so on.

KIA service specialists on the computer see the information necessary for the initial diagnosis for each car.

The software implements communication with KIA technical support. With it, you can quickly get information in an emergency situation: call a tow truck to the scene in case of an accident or a serious breakdown of the car and even find a stolen car.
